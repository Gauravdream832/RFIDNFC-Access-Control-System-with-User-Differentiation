# RFIDNFC-Access-Control-System-with-User-Differentiation

working of project

"In this project, we've integrated a Raspberry Pi with an RFID Read/Write Module (RC522), a breadboard, LEDs, a buzzer, a micro servo, NFC tags, jumper wires, and the concept of blinking to create a secure access control system.

Upon starting the project, a prompt on a connected phone instructs the user to present their RFID card or NFC tag. The system is equipped with five distinct cards: three for entry, one for exit, and one for invalid users. Each card corresponds to a specific user or category.

When a user places their card on the reader, it triggers the system to open a door using the micro servo motor. Simultaneously, an LED associated with the user's card illuminates, providing a visual indication of the user's category. Additionally, a buzzer generates an audible signal to further confirm the card's status.

This project effectively manages access control through RFID/NFC technology, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience while differentiating between valid and invalid users."

objective

The real-life objective of this project is to enhance security and convenience in access control scenarios, such as homes, offices, or any location requiring restricted entry. By implementing RFID/NFC technology, the system ensures that only authorized individuals can gain access. The differentiation of users through unique cards offers tailored access rights, making it suitable for various user categories like employees, visitors, or invalid users. The visual and auditory feedback mechanisms not only confirm access but also provide a clear signal for user category recognition, adding an additional layer of security and user-friendliness. The integration of a micro servo enhances the physical access control aspect, ensuring that the door is only opened for authorized individuals. In real-life applications, this project can significantly improve security and access management, making it a valuable asset in various environments.
